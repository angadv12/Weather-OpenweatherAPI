# Weather-OpenweatherAPI
Simple weather app in Python that uses openweather API to fetch json data
# How to use it
Get an API key from openweathermap.org and store it as API_KEY in a separate file in the project.
It is stored in a file named key.py in my project, thus "from key import API_KEY" in weather.py.
